How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can find easily where the differences occur

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can look at previous versions of the code and see the evolution

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros : right size and logical content of the commit
    Cons : you should not forget to commit when it is necessary

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is useful to allow saving multiple files in one commit when files 
    are related like in the source code of a software, but in the context of 
    documents it is not interesting

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log let you find the commit id of a change
    git diff allow you to view the difference between two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know that I can easyly come back to previous versions of the code and
    revert changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
